DELETE /api/v1/new-feature/{id}
```

**Request/Response Examples:**
```json
// POST /api/v1/new-feature
{
  "request": {
    "parameter1": "value1",
    "parameter2": "value2",
    "options": {
      "setting1": true,
      "setting2": "option_a"
    }
  },

    "id": "feature-123",
    "status": "success",
    "result": {
      "output_data": "processed_result",
      "metadata": {
        "processing_time": "1.23s",
        "confidence": 0.95
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Data Models:**
```python
# Pydantic models for the new feature
class NewFeatureRequest(BaseModel):
    parameter1: str
    parameter2: int
    options: Optional[FeatureOptions] = None

class NewFeatureResponse(BaseModel):
    id: str
    status: str
    result: FeatureResult
    metadata: ResponseMetadata
```

**Database Schema Changes:**
```sql
-- New tables or schema modifications needed
CREATE TABLE new_feature_data (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    parameter1 VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    parameter2 INTEGER NOT NULL,
    result JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_new_feature_user_id ON new_feature_data(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_new_feature_created_at ON new_feature_data(created_at);
```

client = NCSClient(api_key="your-key")

# New feature usage
result = client.new_feature(
    parameter1="value1",
    parameter2=42,
    options={
        "setting1": True,
        "setting2": "option_a"
    }
)

print(f"Feature result: {result.output_data}")
```

**JavaScript SDK:**
```javascript
// Example usage in JavaScript SDK
import { NCSClient } from 'ncs-client';

const client = new NCSClient({ apiKey: 'your-key' });

// New feature usage
const result = await client.newFeature({
  parameter1: 'value1',
  parameter2: 42,
  options: {
    setting1: true,
    setting2: 'option_a'
  }
});

console.log('Feature result:', result.outputData);
```
