# This file ensures the logs directory is tracked by Git
# 
# The logs directory is used for storing application logs during runtime.
# This .gitkeep file maintains the directory structure in version control
# while allowing the actual log files to be excluded via .gitignore.
#
# Note: Actual log files should not be committed to version control
# as they contain runtime data and can become very large.
#
# Log files are typically excluded in .gitignore with patterns like:
# logs/*.log
# logs/*.txt
# logs/app-*.log
# logs/error-*.log
#
# For production deployments, consider using:
# - Centralized logging (ELK Stack, Splunk, etc.)
# - Log rotation to manage disk space
# - Log aggregation for distributed systems
# - Structured logging for better analysis
